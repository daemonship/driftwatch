# driftwatch.yml.example — copy to driftwatch.yml and edit for your setup
#
# driftwatch scans these Terraform workspace directories for drift.
# Each path must contain a Terraform root module (a directory with .tf files
# that has already been initialized with `terraform init`).

workspaces:
  - ./infra/staging
  - ./infra/production

# Optional: Slack incoming webhook URL for drift notifications.
# Overridden by DRIFTWATCH_SLACK_WEBHOOK environment variable if set.
# Silent (no POST) when no drift is detected.
# slack_webhook: https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL

# Optional: use OpenTofu instead of Terraform.
# binary: tofu
